# Why Your Business Needs Microsoft 365 & Google Workspace Backups
Many businesses assume that Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace automatically back up their data. While these platforms provide redundancy and limited retention policies, they are not designed to protect against data loss due to accidental deletion, cyber threats, or compliance needs. Without a dedicated backup solution, your business could be at risk of losing critical data permanently.

## The Risks of Not Having a Backup Solution
### 1. Accidental Deletion Happens More Often Than You Think
Employees often delete files or emails, thinking they won’t need them again. But what happens when you do? Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace have limited retention windows, and once those expire, the data is gone for good. A third-party backup solution ensures that even mistakenly deleted files can be recovered easily.

### 2. Insider Threats & Ransomware Attacks
Internal threats—whether intentional or accidental—are a growing concern. Employees leaving a company might delete critical data, or worse, malicious actors could encrypt or wipe your data. Ransomware attacks also pose a significant risk, often locking businesses out of their own files. With Engram Vault’s backups, your data remains safe with versioning and Insider Protection features to prevent data tampering.

### 3. Compliance & Legal Hold Requirements
Many industries require businesses to retain emails and files for extended periods to meet regulatory requirements. Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace have retention policies, but they are often complex to manage and can be costly. Our backup solutions help simplify compliance by offering long-term storage and easy retrieval of archived data.

### 4. Microsoft & Google Are Not Responsible for Your Data
Both Microsoft and Google operate under a "Shared Responsibility Model." This means they maintain the infrastructure but expect you to safeguard your own data. If you suffer data loss due to human error, cyber threats, or policy misconfigurations, Microsoft and Google won’t restore it for you.
