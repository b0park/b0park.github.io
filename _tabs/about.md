# Guardians of Your Data's Resilience
Engram Vault was founded by an experienced IT Director who observed a knowledge gap in the use of Veeam and backup tools. Seeing this as a challenge for MSPs, Engram Vault was created to reduce this burden and provide recovery expertise when it's needed the most, during a disaster. We simplify the complex pricing structure of backups by being inspired by cellphone plans with an access license per endpoint and a reserved storage pool.

## Our Mission:
At Engram Vault, we aim to become the guardians of your data, providing a fully managed backup and storage solution. We understand the importance of data resiliency and will be there for our partners, MSPs, through the entire relationship. From managing and deploying Veeam servers, providing all necessary licensing, and handling backup jobs, schedules, and efficiency, we are partners in data resiliency.

### Simplifying Backups with Cellphone-Inspired Pricing:
We understand that managing backups can be complex, and pricing structures can be even more so. That's why we simplify it by being inspired by cellphone plans with an access license per endpoint and a reserved storage pool starting at 1TB increments. We eliminate the need to manage multiple data centers, preserve your valuable resources, and free up your team to focus on their core mission, reducing your total cost of ownership (TCO).

### More Than Just BaaS: Your Partner in Data Resiliency:
We are more than just a backup-as-a-service (BaaS) provider. We are your partners in data resiliency. We monitor our storage usage for MSPs, server availability, backup jobs themselves, and the health of the data stored 24/7. We assist during a disaster as another pair of hands in the recovery process, ensuring that you have access to the resources and expertise necessary to implement Veeam.

### Our Promise to MSPs: Never Sell Directly to Customers:
At Engram Vault, we promise never to sell directly to your customers. We intend to serve MSPs, so they can provide a robust product to their clients with our backup services. We believe that our success is directly tied to the success of our partners, and we are committed to supporting them in every way possible.

### Our Data Centers: Meeting the Demands of US MSPs:
We are based out of North Central Florida, but we have data centers all over the continental US to meet the demands of US MSPs. Our data centers are designed with redundancy in mind, ensuring that our partners have access to their data when they need it most.

Engram Vault is committed to providing a fully managed backup and storage solution, simplifying backups with cellphone-inspired pricing, and being more than just a BaaS provider. We are partners in data resiliency, and our success is directly tied to the success of our partners. Join us today and become the guardian of your data.
