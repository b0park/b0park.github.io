# Simple predictable pricing for Google Workspace Backups. — Access + Reserved Shared Storage Pool.

The MSP's Secret Weapon for Stress-Free Workspace Backups

## Features:

### Ease of use.
Protecting your clients Google Workspace data, i**ncluding Google Drive, Shared Drives, Gmail, Contacts, and Calendar, with automatic, hourly backups.** We back up not only files and messages, but also all metadata, such as file permissions and Gmail labels.

### Reliability.
Restores are just as easy as backups. You can restore individual files or entire folders, and you can choose to restore to a specific point in time.

**You can also restore data to a different account, even an account in another domain.** This is useful if you need to restore data to a new employee's account or if you need to recover data from a deleted account.

### Scalability.
Automatically detect and back up new users and Shared drives added to your clients’ Google Workspace. There is no need to adjust your subscription or worry about manually backing up your data.

**Shared Drives don't require additional access licenses. They just use your Shared Storage Pool.** As your clients' businesses grow, we can scale to meet their growing storage needs.

### Security.
Engram Vault offers a variety of security features to protect your data, including:

**Encryption:** All data is encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption algorithms.

**Authentication:** User authentication is required to access Engram Vault, and we offer a variety of authentication methods, including two-factor authentication.

**Auditing:** Engram Vault logs all user activity, so you can track who has accessed your data and when.

**Compliance:** Engram Vault is compliant with a variety of industry standards, including HIPAA and GDPR.

We believe that security is essential for any business that handles sensitive data. That's why we offer a comprehensive set of security features to protect your data.

### Affordability.
We understand that affordability is a top concern for businesses of all sizes. That's why we offer a simple, affordable pricing structure that is designed to fit your budget.

Our pricing is based on two factors:

**Access fee**: This is a monthly fee that gives a licensed Workspace user access to our backup vault.

**Storage pool fee**: This is a monthly fee that is based on the amount of data you reserve to store in our backup vault.

Additionally, our storage pool can be used for backups of other services we provide you. This means that you can consolidate your storage costs and increase your profits.

For example, if we also provide Veeam backup services, you can store all of your customer data in your purchased storage pool. This would save you the cost of having to purchase and maintain separate storage for each service.

### Support.
Our Workspace Backups is a service that provides both storage and restoration capabilities. We offer a self-service portal that your clients or MSP staff can use to perform their own restores. However, if your clients are busy working on getting the rest of their services back online after a disaster, or they just don't want to bother with performing their own restores, they can just call us. **We're here to help and assist with restoring backups at no additional cost.** This way, you as an MSP can continue to assist with other matters, or your clients can work on getting other business objectives completed so they can get back to business.

## Why do Cloud Services like Google Workspace need backups?

"Google is not responsible for any loss or damage to your data, including but not limited to data loss or damage caused by: (a) hardware or software failure; (b) unauthorized access or use of your account; (c) viruses or other malicious code; or (d) any other cause beyond Google's control."

#### — Section 10 Google Terms of Service

The section states that Google "will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the security and availability of your data." However, it also states that Google "is not responsible for any loss or corruption of your data," and that "you are responsible for backing up your data."

#### — Section 11 Google Terms of Service Data Backup and Retention.

We will retain your data for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we will delete your data within 30 days, unless we are required by law to retain it for a longer period of time.

We may also retain your data if we believe it is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our terms and conditions.

You are responsible for backing up your data. We do not guarantee that your data will be recoverable if it is lost or deleted.

We encourage you to create backups of your data on a regular basis. You can do this by exporting your data or using a third-party backup service.
