# Protect your clients‚Äô Core Microsoft 365 Applications
Easy, Scalable backups. Access + Reserved Shared Storage Pool

## Purpose built for our MSP Partners

### Ease of Use.

Protecting your clients Microsoft 365 data, including Mail, Exchange, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for business, Contacts, and Calendar, with **automatic, hourly backups**. We back up not only files and messages, but also all metadata, such as file permissions and folders.

### Scalability.

Automatically detect and back up new users and their apps added to your clients‚Äô Microsoft 365 domain. There is no need to adjust your subscription or worry about manually backing up your data.

Everything just uses your Reserved Shared Storage Pool. **As your clients' businesses grow, we can scale to meet their growing storage needs.**

### Security.

Engram Vault offers a variety of security features to protect your data, including:

**Encryption:** All data is encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption algorithms.

**Compliance:** Engram Vault is compliant with a variety of industry standards, including HIPAA and GDPR.

We believe that security is essential for any business that handles sensitive data. That's why we offer a comprehensive set of security features to protect your data.

### Reliability.

Restores are just as easy as backups. You can restore individual files or entire folders, and you can choose to restore to a specific point in time.

You can also restore data to a different account. This is useful if you need to restore data to a new employee's account or if you need to **recover data from a deleted account**.

### Support.

Our Microsoft 365 Backups is a service that provides both storage and restoration capabilities. We offer a self-service portal that your clients or MSP staff can use to perform their own restores. However, if your clients are busy working on getting the rest of their services back online after a disaster, or they just don't want to bother with performing their own restores, they can just call us. **We're here to help and assist with restoring backups at no additional cost.** This way, you as an MSP can continue to assist with other matters, or your clients can work on getting other business objectives completed so they can get back to business.

### Affordability.

We understand that affordability is a top concern for businesses of all sizes. That's why we offer a simple, affordable pricing structure that is designed to fit your budget.

Our pricing is based on two factors:

**Access fee**: This is a monthly fee that gives a licensed Workspace user access to our backup vault.

**Storage pool fee**: This is a monthly fee that is based on the amount of data you reserve to store in our backup vault.

Additionally, our storage pool can be used for backups of other services we provide you. This means that you can **consolidate your storage costs and increase your profits.**

For example, if we also provide Veeam backup services, you can store all of your customer data in your purchased storage pool. This would save you the cost of having to purchase and maintain separate storage for each service.
